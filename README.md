# Cameron-portfolio
this is meant to be for my portfolio website. Its still being worked on, I need to sit and decide what theme I want to go with as am not sure if I love the dark colors. Also: I need to do a lot of general formatting and want to add another section. 

The photos for the "work" section are only placeholders  and im hoping to put better examples there.

this was my first attempt at using Bootstrap as well, overall it was pretty fun to use, i can see how it can help build a website quickly, although I definitley need more practice with it.


****ALSO, yes, the website is currently unhosted until I figure out where would be a good fit.******
